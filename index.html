        <p>I am from central Illinois, where I live with my wonderful husband and our two children (6 and 3). 
            Currently I am a stay-at-home mom, I keep myself busy with two kids, three callings, school, and 
            lots of sewing. I am working towards a Bachelors in Applied Technology, with about a year and a 
            half until graduation.</p>

        <p>Illinois is a state of contrasts, where the bustling metropolis of Chicago coexists with the rural 
            charm of the countryside. You can visit the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, admire 
            the scenic beauty of the Mississippi River, or sample the local flavors and farm-to-table cuisine.</p>
