            <p>I am from central Illinois, where I live with my wonderful husband and our two children (6 and 3).
                Durring our almost twelve years of marriage we have lived in eight different areas, all located 
                in central Illinois. Though I have worked at a few places, most recently I worked at State Farm's 
                Corporate Office. Currently I am a stay-at-home mom while I am working on my Bachelors in Applied 
                Technology, with about a year and a half until graduation. When I am not studying, I keep myself 
                busy these days with my two kids, three callings, and lots of sewing.</p>
            <p>In addition to my love for technology, I am an avid quilter. Every spare minuite I have is spent 
                sitting at a sewing machine or with my noes in a book. Though I can crochet, knit, embroider, 
                paint, and much more; my passion has always been to quilt. There is something special about a quilt 
                that brings comfort and love to those they are gifted to.</p>

            <p>Illinois is a state of contrasts, where the bustling metropolis of Chicago coexists with the rural 
                charm of the countryside. You can visit the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, admire 
                the scenic beauty of the Mississippi River, or sample the local flavors and farm-to-table cuisine.</p>
