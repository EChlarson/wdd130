        <p>I am from central Illinois, where I live with my wonderful husband and our two children (6 and 3). 
            Currently I am a stay-at-home mom, I keep myself busy with two kids, three callings, school, and 
            lots of sewing. I am working towards a Bachelors in Applied Technology, with about a year and a 
            half until graduation.</p>
